        <h3>Files</h3>
    </header>
    A seperate file is created for each <strong>realm</strong>, and,
    for each realm, its <strong>key properties</strong>,
    its <strong>grid</strong>, each of its <strong>processes</strong>.

    All files contain three different type of variables:
    <ol>
      <li>Metadata variables which state which model component is
          being described, who contributed to creating the file
          contents and the quality control status of the file contents
      <li>Internal variables required by the ES-DOC tools which use 
          the files
      <li>The variables which describe a model conponent
    </ol>

        <h3>Metadata variables</h3>
    </header>
    A file must contain the following metadata variables:
    <dl>
      <dt>CONTACT
	<dd>The point of contact for any questions about the
	file. There are no restrictions on the value
	(e.g. <code>CONTACT ='David Hassell, NCAS,
	email@address'</code>).

      <dt>AUTHORS
	<dd>The names of all those contributed to the file contents.
    	    There are no restrictions on the value (e.g. <code>AUTHORS
    	    = 'David Hassell, NCAS, email@address; Charlotte Pascoe,
    	    NCAS, email@address'</code>).
	  
      <dt>QC_STATUS
	<dd>The quality control status of the file ccontent. Allowed
    	    values are <code>'draft'</code> (content still being
    	    developed), <code>'complete'</code> (content complete and
    	    ready to be ingested into ES-DOC),
	    <code>'accepted'</code> (accepted and ingested by ES-DOC -
	    this value should only be set by ES-DOC
	    developers). Examples: <code>QC_STATUS =
	    'complete'</code>.

      <dt>ID
	<dd>A unique identifier for the file of the
	form <code>'cmip6.<REALM>'</code>,
	or <code>'cmip6.<REALM>.<COMPONENT>'</code>
	where <code><REALM></code> represents the model realm being
	described (e.g. <code>atmosphere</code>)
	and <code><COMPONENT></code> represents the realm component
	being described, one
	of <code>key_properties</code>, <code>grid</code>, or a model
	process (e.g. <code>cloud_scheme</code>).
    </dl>

    These variables are preset in model component file templates and
    it is expected that they will be changed during the creation of a
    new file.

        <h3>Internal variables</h3>
    </header>
    A file must contain the following internal variables, which are
    preset in the model component file templates and <strong>should be
    not changed during the creation of a new file</strong>:
    <dl>
      <dt></code>_TYPE</code>
	<dd>The CIM construct type of the model component
     	    (e.g. <code>_TYPE = 'cim.2.science.process'</code>
      <dt><code>from collections import OrderedDict()</code>
	<dd>Not actually a variable, but a python instruction required
    	    by the ES-DOC tools which will use the file.
    </dl>
